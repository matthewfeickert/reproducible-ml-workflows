## CUDA

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) [is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone).
The CUDA ecosystem provides software developer software development kits (SDK) with APIs to CUDA that allow for software developers to write hardware accelerated programs with CUDA in various languages for NVIDIA GPUs.
CUDA supports a number of languages including C, C++, Fortran, Python, and Julia.
While there are other types of hardware acceleration development platforms, as of 2025 CUDA is the most abundant platform for scientific computing that uses GPUs and effectively the default choice for major machine learning libraries and applications.

CUDA is closed source and proprietary to NVIDIA, which means that NVIDIA has historically limited the download access of the CUDA toolkits and drivers to registered NVIDIA developers (while keeping the software free (monetarily) to use).
CUDA then required a [multi-step installation process](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/) with manual steps and decisions based on the target platform and particular CUDA version.
This meant that when CUDA enabled environments were setup on a particular machine they were powerful and optimized, but brittle to change and could easily be broken if system wide updates (like for security fixes) occurred.
CUDA software environments were bespoke and not many scientists understood how to construct and curate them.

## CUDA on conda-forge

In [late 2018](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/687) to better support the scientific developer community, NVIDIA started to release components of the CUDA toolkits on the [`nvidia` conda channel](https://anaconda.org/nvidia).
This provided the first access to start to create conda environments where the versions of different CUDA tools could be directly specified and downloaded.
However, all of this work was being done internally in NVIDIA and as it was on a separate channel it was less visible and it still required additional knowledge to work with.
In [2023](https://youtu.be/WgKwlGgVzYE?si=hfyAo6qLma8hnJ-N), NVIDIA's open source team began to move the release of CUDA conda packages from the `nvidia` channel to conda-forge, making it easier to discover and allowing for community support.
With significant advancements in system driver specification support, CUDA 12 became the first version of CUDA to be released as conda packages through conda-forge and included all CUDA libraries from the [CUDA compiler `nvcc`](https://github.com/conda-forge/cuda-nvcc-feedstock) to the [CUDA development libraries](https://github.com/conda-forge/cuda-libraries-dev-feedstock).
They also released [CUDA metapackages](https://github.com/conda-forge/cuda-feedstock/) that allowed users to easily describe the version of CUDA they required (e.g. `cuda-version=12.5`) and the CUDA conda packages they wanted (e.g. `cuda`).
This significantly improved the ability for researchers to easily create CUDA accelerated computing environments.

This is all possible via use of the `__cuda` [virtual conda package](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-virtual.html), which is determined automatically by conda package managers from the hardware information associated with the machine the package manager is installed on.

With Pixi, a user can get this information with [`pixi info`](https://pixi.sh/latest/advanced/explain_info_command/), which could have output that looks something like

```bash
pixi info
```
```output

```

## CUDA use with Pixi

To be able to effectively use CUDA conda packages with Pixi, we make use of Pixi's [system requirement workspace table](https://pixi.sh/latest/workspace/system_requirements/), which specifies the **minimum**  system specifications needed to install and run a Pixi workspace's environments.

To do this for CUDA, we just add the minimum supported CUDA version (based on the host machine's NVIDIA driver API) we want to support to the table.

Example:

```toml
[system-requirements]
cuda = "12"  # Replace "12" with the specific CUDA version you intend to use
```

This ensures that packages depending on `__cuda >= {version}` are resolved correctly.

To demonstrate this a bit more explicitly, we can create a minimal project

```bash
pixi init ~/pixi-cuda-lesson/cuda-example
cd ~/pixi-cuda-lesson/cuda-example
```
```output
✔ Created /home/<username>/pixi-cuda-lesson/cuda-example/pixi.toml
```

where we specify a `cuda` system requirement

```bash
pixi workspace system-requirements add cuda 12
```

```toml
[workspace]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
name = "cuda-example"
platforms = ["linux-64"]
version = "0.1.0"

[tasks]

[dependencies]

[system-requirements]
cuda = "12"
```

::: caution

## `system-requirements` table can't be target specific

As of [Pixi `v0.50.2`](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/releases/tag/v0.50.2), [the `system-requirements` table can't be target specific](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/issues/2714).
To work around this, if you're on a platform that doesn't support the `system-requirements` it will ignore them without erroring unless they are required for the platform specific packages or actions you have.
So, for example, you can have `osx-arm64` as a platform and a `system-requirements` of `cuda = "12"` defined

```toml
[workspace]
...
platforms = ["linux-64"]
...

[system-requirements]
cuda = "12"
```

Pixi will ignore that requirement unless you try to use CUDA packages in `osx-arm64` environments.

:::

and then install the [`cuda-version` metapacakge](https://github.com/conda-forge/cuda-version-feedstock/blob/main/recipe/README.md)

```bash
pixi add "cuda-version 12.9.*"
```
```output
✔ Added cuda-version 12.9.*
```

```toml
[workspace]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
name = "cuda-example"
platforms = ["linux-64"]
version = "0.1.0"

[tasks]

[dependencies]
cuda-version = "12.9.*"

[system-requirements]
cuda = "12"
```

If we look at the metadata installed by the `cuda-version` package (the only thing it does)

```bash
cat .pixi/envs/default/conda-meta/cuda-version-*.json
```
```json
{
  "build": "h4f385c5_3",
  "build_number": 3,
  "constrains": [
    "cudatoolkit 12.9|12.9.*",
    "__cuda >=12"
  ],
  "depends": [],
  "license": "LicenseRef-NVIDIA-End-User-License-Agreement",
  "md5": "b6d5d7f1c171cbd228ea06b556cfa859",
  "name": "cuda-version",
  "noarch": "generic",
  "sha256": "5f5f428031933f117ff9f7fcc650e6ea1b3fef5936cf84aa24af79167513b656",
  "size": 21578,
  "subdir": "noarch",
  "timestamp": 1746134436166,
  "version": "12.9",
  "fn": "cuda-version-12.9-h4f385c5_3.conda",
  "url": "https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/noarch/cuda-version-12.9-h4f385c5_3.conda",
  "channel": "https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/",
  "extracted_package_dir": "/home/<username>/.cache/rattler/cache/pkgs/cuda-version-12.9-h4f385c5_3",
  "files": [],
  "paths_data": {
    "paths_version": 1,
    "paths": []
  },
  "link": {
    "source": "/home/<username>/.cache/rattler/cache/pkgs/cuda-version-12.9-h4f385c5_3",
    "type": 1
  }
}
```

we see that it now enforces constraints on the versions of `cudatoolkit` that can be installed as well as the required `__cuda` virtual package provided by the system

```json
{
  ...
  "constrains": [
    "cudatoolkit 12.9|12.9.*",
    "__cuda >=12"
  ],
  ...
}
```

::: callout

## Use the `feature` table to solve environment that your platform doesn't support

CUDA is supported only by NVIDIA GPUs, which means that macOS operating system platforms (`osx-64`, `osx-arm64`) can't support it.
Similarly, if you machine doesn't have an NVIDIA GPU, then the `__cuda` virtual package won't exist and installs of CUDA packages will fail.
However, there's many situations in which you want to **solve and environment for a platform that you don't have** and we can do this for CUDA as well.

If we make the Pixi workspace multiplatform

```bash
pixi workspace platform add linux-64 osx-arm64 win-64
```
```output
✔ Added linux-64
✔ Added osx-arm64
✔ Added win-64
```

```toml
[workspace]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
name = "cuda-example"
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]
version = "0.1.0"

[tasks]

[dependencies]
```

We can then use Pixi's [platform specific `target` tables](https://pixi.sh/latest/reference/pixi_manifest/#the-target-table) to add dependencies for an environment to only a specific platform.
So, if we know that a dependency only exists for platform <platform> then we can have Pixi add it for only that platform with

```bash
pixi add --platform <platform> <dependency>
```

:::

This now means that if we ask for any CUDA enbabled packages, we will get ones that are built to support `cudatoolkit` `v12.9.*`

```bash
pixi add --platform linux-64 cuda
```
```output
✔ Added cuda >=12.9.1,<13
Added these only for platform(s): linux-64
```

```bash
pixi list --platform linux-64 cuda
```
```output

Let's first add `python` as a common dependency

```bash
pixi add python
```
```output
✔ Added python >=3.13.5,<3.14
```

Add `pytorch-cpu` to a `cpu` feature

```bash
pixi add --feature cpu pytorch-cpu
```
```output
✔ Added pytorch-cpu
Added these only for feature: cpu
```

and then create a `cpu` environment that contains the `cpu` feature

```bash
pixi workspace environment add --feature cpu cpu
```
```output
✔ Added environment cpu
```

and then instantiate the `pytorch-cpu` package with a particular version and solve through [`pixi upgrade`](https://pixi.sh/dev/reference/cli/pixi/upgrade/) (or could readd the package to the feature)

```bash
pixi upgrade --feature cpu pytorch-cpu
```
```output
✔ Added pytorch-cpu >=2.7.1,<3
Added these only for feature: cpu
```

```toml
[workspace]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
name = "cuda-exercise"
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]
version = "0.1.0"

[tasks]

[dependencies]
python = ">=3.13.5,<3.14"

[feature.cpu.dependencies]
pytorch-cpu = ">=2.7.1,<3"

[environments]
cpu = ["cpu"]
```

Now, for the GPU environment, add CUDA system-requirements for `linux-64` for the `gpu` feature

```bash
pixi workspace system-requirements add --feature gpu cuda 12
```

```toml
[workspace]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
name = "cuda-exercise"
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]
version = "0.1.0"

[tasks]

[dependencies]
python = ">=3.13.5,<3.14"

[feature.cpu.dependencies]
pytorch-cpu = ">=2.7.1,<3"

[feature.gpu.system-requirements]
cuda = "12"

[environments]
cpu = ["cpu"]
```

and create a `gpu` environment with the `gpu` feature

```bash
pixi workspace environment add --feature gpu gpu
```
```output
✔ Added environment gpu
```

```toml
[workspace]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
name = "cuda-exercise"
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]
version = "0.1.0"

[tasks]

[dependencies]
python = ">=3.13.5,<3.14"

[feature.cpu.dependencies]
pytorch-cpu = ">=2.7.1,<3"

[feature.gpu.system-requirements]
cuda = "12"

[environments]
cpu = ["cpu"]
gpu = ["gpu"]
```

then add the `pytorch-gpu` pacakge for `linux-64` and `win-64` to the `gpu` feature

```bash
pixi add --platform linux-64 --platform win-64 --feature gpu pytorch-gpu
```
```output
✔ Added pytorch-gpu >=2.7.1,<3
Added these only for platform(s): linux-64, win-64
Added these only for feature: gpu
```

```toml
[workspace]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
name = "cuda-exercise"
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-arm64", "win-64"]
version = "0.1.0"

[tasks]

[dependencies]
python = ">=3.13.5,<3.14"

[feature.cpu.dependencies]
pytorch-cpu = ">=2.7.1,<3"

[feature.gpu.system-requirements]
cuda = "12"

[feature.gpu.target.linux-64.dependencies]
pytorch-gpu = ">=2.7.1,<3"

[feature.gpu.target.win-64.dependencies]
pytorch-gpu = ">=2.7.1,<3"

[environments]
cpu = ["cpu"]
gpu = ["gpu"]
```

One can check the environment differences

```bash
pixi list --environment cpu
pixi list --environment gpu
```

and activate shells with different environments loaded

```bash
pixi shell --environment cpu
```

So in 26 lines of TOML

```bash
wc -l pixi.toml
```
```output
26 pixi.toml
```

we created separate CPU and GPU computational environments that are now fully reproducible with the associated `pixi.lock`!

::: keypoints

* The `cuda-version` metapackage can be used to specify constrains on the versions of the `__cuda` virtual package and `cudatoolkit`.
* Pixi can specify a minimum required CUDA version with the `[system-requirements]` table.
* Pixi can solve environments for platforms that are not the system platform.
* NVIDIA's open source team and the conda-forge community support the CUDA conda packages on conda-forge.
* The [`cuda` metapackage](https://github.com/conda-forge/cuda-feedstock/tree/main/recipe) is the primary place to go for user documetnation on the CUDA conda packages.
