> [!TIP]
> This lesson uses [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench].

## Using the lesson

To step through the lesson, please follow it on its website at https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/reproducible-ml-workflows/

## Developing the lesson

Similar to the lesson itself, development of the lesson uses [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) to have unified multi-platform reproducible environments.
To start developing:

1. [Install Pixi](https://pixi.sh/)
2. [Fork this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/reproducible-ml-workflows/fork)
3. Clone your fork and navigate to the top level of the repository
4. Run

```
pixi run start
```

and then open up the served site in your local browser and carry on with development.
