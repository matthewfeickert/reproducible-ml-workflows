## Glossary

Computer platform
: The computer operating system and instruction set architecture.
  Example: Linux x86 refers to the Linux ecosystem of operating systems on a machine with an x86-64 instruction set architecture.
  For a conda package this would be expressed as `linux-64`.

Computational reproducibility
: Methods that allow for a program to create a full hash level reproduction of a computational software environment for a given computer platform.

[Pixi](https://pixi.sh/)
: A package and software environment management tool that allows for fully reproducible multi-platform software environments.
  Pixi currently supports management of conda packages from conda package indexes (e.g. [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), [S3 buckets](https://pixi.sh/latest/deployment/s3/)) and Python packages from Python package indexes (e.g. [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)).
